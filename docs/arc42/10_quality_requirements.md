# 10. Quality Requirements

- **Correctness:** The library must generate syntactically valid PlantUML text to be processed by downstream renderers.
- **Coverage transparency:** The documentation must clearly state which PlantUML commands are implemented, partial, or missing to set expectations for users.
- **Open-source clarity:** Licensing and reuse terms must remain clear for contributors and international users of the open-source library.
